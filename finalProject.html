    <h1>Aiden's Final Project</h1>
    <p>The game displayed here is the culmination of over a month of work on developing something that mimics the classic game known as Space Invaders. Our own personal design of this, which we have decided to call Space Force, shares a similar objective and controls. To play the game, the user can move the user ship left or right, and can fire bullets at the incoming enemy ships. If the user ship makes contact with an enemy ship, the user's health is lowered, and if it eventually reaches zero, the game is over. The player can advance further in the game by shooting down the enemies and gaining points and progressing into further levels. Space force was designed using object-oriented programming. The user ship, the projectiles, and the enemies are all objects with methods assigned to them that dictate the actions they can perform.</p>
